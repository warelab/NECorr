# Bn_seed_atlas_par_1

## Overview

This project integrates miRNA, mRNA, and protein expression data to understand the regulatory networks and molecular mechanisms underlying seed development in Brassica. The analysis involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading**: Load necessary datasets and libraries.
2.  **miRNA Analysis**: Predict miRNA targets and identify interactions.
3.  **mRNA Co-expression Analysis**: Normalize gene expression data and calculate correlations to generate a co-expression network.
4.  **Network-Based Analysis**: Project Arabidopsis molecular networks onto Brassica, construct a comprehensive network, and filter using co-expression data.
5.  **Differential Expression Analysis**: Conduct DEG analysis for mRNA and miRNA across different tissues.
6.  **Functional Enrichment**: Analyze pathways and gene ontology for enriched pathways.
7.  **Multi-omics Integration**: Integrate and analyze multi-omics data using MOFA and XGBoost.
8.  **Visualization**: Visualize sub-networks and dimensional reduction.

## Requirements

-   R (version 4.0 or higher)
-   R packages: `ggplot2`, `ggraph`, `igraph`, `muxViz`, `readxl`, `tidyverse`, `DESeq2`, `dplyr`, `tibble`, `BiocParallel`, `org.At.tair.db`, `pathview`, `gage`, `limma`, `openxlsx`, `stringr`, `plyr`

## Usage

1.  **Set Up Environment**: Ensure all required R packages are installed. Set the working directory and source any required functions.
2.  **Run Analysis**: Execute each function in the provided R script. Functions are modularized for clarity and ease of use.
3.  **Visualize Results**: Use provided visualization functions to explore the data and results.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling to notify users of issues during data loading and processing.

## Enhancements

-   Functions are encapsulated for modularity and reusability.
-   Enhanced visualizations with clear and informative plots.
-   Improved documentation for ease of understanding and collaboration.
