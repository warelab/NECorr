\description{
Combine TSI/TSE tests and IUT to determine tissue-specific and tissue-excluded genes.
}
\details{
This function iteratively applies the Intersection-Union Test (IUT)
to identify tissue-specific (TS) and tissue-excluded (TE) genes.
It starts with stringent criteria and relaxes them if not enough genes are found.
The process continues until at least \code{minGenes} are found or \code{maxIter} is reached.
The function returns filtered TS and TE gene lists.
